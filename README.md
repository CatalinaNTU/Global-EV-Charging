# Global Charging Patterns

This repository contains analysis and visualizations of global electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns, originally developed in Kaggle: [Global Charging Patterns](https://www.kaggle.com/code/catalinasepulvedan/global-charging-patterns).

## Overview

Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular worldwide. Understanding charging behavior is essential for infrastructure planning, grid management, and policy decisions. This project explores global EV charging data to uncover trends, usage patterns, and regional differences.

## Contents

- **Data Exploration:** Initial inspection and cleaning of the dataset.
- **Visualizations:** Plots and charts that illustrate charging frequency, time-of-day usage, geographic distribution, and more.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Insights into peak charging hours, differences by region, and correlations with external factors.
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks with reproducible code and explanations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/global-charging-patterns.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the analysis notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/global_charging_patterns.ipynb
   ```

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. Refer to the [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/catalinasepulvedan/global-charging-patterns) for direct data links and additional context.

## Results

Key findings include:
- Identification of global peak charging hours.
- Regional differences in charging habits.
- Insights into the relationship between charging patterns and infrastructure availability.
